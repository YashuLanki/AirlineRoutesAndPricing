# Predict Fare of Airline Tickets using ML: Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on features like source, destination, airline, and number of stops.
- **Dataset**: Includes flight details such as airline, route, departure and arrival times, stops, and pricing information.
- **Approach**: Apply regression algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict ticket prices, with preprocessing like handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data to improve model accuracy.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and other data science libraries for analysis and model building.

 ### Code and Resources Used
 - **Python Version:** 3.11
 - **Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, pickle
 - **Dataset:** Dataset provided as part of the Udemy course "Build Data Science Real World Projects in AI, ML, NLP, and Time Series Domain"
