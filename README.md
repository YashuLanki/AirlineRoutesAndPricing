# Predict Fare of Airline Tickets using ML: Project Overview
- **Dataset Overview**: Contains flight details including airline, route, departure and arrival times, stops, and pricing information.
- **Goal**: Develop a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on flight features such as source, destination, airline, number of stops, duration, and more.
- **Features**: Key features include airline, source, destination, flight route, duration, stops, and additional information like meal inclusion.
- **Target Variable**: The target variable is the **Price**, which represents the cost of the airline ticket.
- **Approach**: Use regression algorithms (such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest) to predict ticket prices.
- **Potential Use Cases**: Can be used for price prediction tools, dynamic pricing strategies, and travel planning applications.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data to improve model accuracy.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and other data science libraries for analysis and model building.
